🎬 AI-Powered Movie Recommender System Using TMDB API & Machine Learning 🍿🚀
Super excited to share my Movie Recommendation System that suggests top 5 similar movies based on your selection — complete with posters fetched from the TMDB API! 💡✨
🔧 Tech Stack & Features:
 ✅ Python + Streamlit for interactive UI
 ✅ Scikit-learn & Pickle for ML model & similarity matrix
 ✅ TMDB API for fetching real-time movie posters
 ✅ Recommends based on cosine similarity between movie vectors
 ✅ Clean and responsive UI with 5 side-by-side recommendations
This project taught me how to blend machine learning, API integration, and UI development to build something both functional and fun. 🎯
 Excited to keep improving it—maybe next stop: personalized recommendations with user ratings!
